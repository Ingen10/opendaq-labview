LabVIEW is not an open source platform like most of the things related with openDAQ. 
It is licensed by National Instruments. If you are interested, in their website there 
are some evaluation and student-discount versions available:

Note that using openDAQ is not similar to using NI hardware in LabVIEW. 
You will not be able to use Measurement & Automation Explorer, DAQ Assistant, or similar 
NI wizards with openDAQ.

* DAQcontrol: This is a demo of complete test panels. It has user controls to access via 
Comand-Response mode to most of the device functions, including: Analog Inputs, Analog Output, 
Digital I/Os, and Timer/Counter functions (PWM, Capture and Counter).

* EasyDAQ: The other demo program provides an easy way to configure and perform stream mode experiments.
